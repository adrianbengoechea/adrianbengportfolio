  <a name="about" class="anchor"></a>

  <p>I build e-commerce solutions that solve real business problems for small businesses and startups. With 4+ years of full-stack development experience, I specialize in transforming complex requirements into clean, scalable WordPress and Shopify solutions.
  What drives my work: Every project is a custom product built specifically for a client's needs—not just another task. I combine deep technical expertise with a research-first approach, ensuring solutions are functional, maintainable, and built to last.
  My technical foundation:</p>

  <p>WordPress: Expert in action hooks, custom theme/plugin development, and WooCommerce ecosystems
  Shopify: Proficient in Liquid theming, app development (React + App Bridge), and complex third-party integrations
  Philosophy: Write functional, readable, scalable code first; optimize for performance second</p>

  <p>What colleagues value: Punctuality, dedication, and a patient yet proactive communication style that turns unclear requirements into successful deliveries.
  Currently expanding into: React, TypeScript, system architecture, and AI optimization—always combining established technologies to strengthen my full-stack capabilities.</p>
